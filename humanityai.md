I think if humanity ever creates artificial intelligence complex enough to experience effects similar to
emotions, fear, pain, having ability to self-reflect and identify itself, people would have to apply the same or similar basic 
human rights to this creature - not running and destroying it in simulations, do not put it into conditions
that it will experience effects similar to suffering.

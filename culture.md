# Company culture

There are many ideas about good and bad company culture, suggestions on how to build one and different 
experiments conducted by founders building company culture.

There are many debates on what consitutes good or bad company culture, what are good and bad company values.

E.g. some folk consider "Customer first" a bad company culture core value and some consider "No B.S." a good one.

## Questions and concerns

In the spirit of questioning everything, I am asking myself all those questions:

### Why have special corporate culture at all?

Why company needs somewhat special culture or core values different from the culture of the society it exists in? 

I think that there is a perception that special culture somehow contributes to the company success or failure,
differentiates the company somehow from the competition and makes it good or a bad place to work. 
(e.g. Amazon famous culture).

However I have never read the actual study on effects of corporate culture on the company success.

The second argument that I've heard is that culture could be used to attract like-minded individuals,
however in my opinion it is hard to quantify what "like mindedness" usually means and whether it 
leads to good results. 

Even at companies I worked at/created were stating implicit minor culture principles, that proved to be successfully challenged
by people joining the team - e.g. some folks did not like text editors (something we declared in our text ad) and liked
"enterprisey text editors" we did not like.

The third argument is that company culture can be used as a safe guard - to signal that company is a safe 
work environment for minorities. This argument resonates with me, but I am not sure why the culture for it has to be somewhat unique -
why not simply state and reiterate that common society principles are respected in the company. (I'm going to elaborate on this 
bit later).

### Dangers of implementing corporate culture.

Implementing any corporate culture is doing a social experiment on the company, sometimes
under pressure and with limited time span. Here are some dangers I see when implementing and enforcing 
company culture:

* Implementation is usually done and promoted by leadership, this means there is a strong i
  incentive to everyone to "play along" even if they disagree. Even when declared as collaborative process
  still usually enforced and implemented by leadership. Middle management can use this as an opportunity
  to get rid of folks who usually disagree.
* Failure of the expermient can result in company failure or high churn - e.g. Zappos and Github with their 
  flat hierarchies.
* Methods are very scientifically unproven, e.g. folks conduct special "culture panels" filtering out candidates,
  but how do they know they have succeeded? Do they have a control group for this experiment? How do they 
  measure any success or failure? Do they conduct anonimous interviews and studies to check effects?
* Very often leads to attracting "business consultants" helping out with culture - six sigma style folks who 
  distract and annoy people. As in "Pacific Bell Story" from 1987 using some obscure half mystic techniques and imposing
  them on the poor working folks.

## No special culture

The society we live in promotes some basic core values we all share, e.g. be kind and respectful to each other, be polite, 
celebrate diversity and so on. Those basic principles are the fabric of our society, often invisible, ever changing,
but we can feel their presence and common agreement on all of them already.

Living in U.S. also teaches us to respect freedom of speech, promotes spirit of enterpreneurship, accept failure and 
establishes the rule of the law - great values in my opinion that are keys to America success story.

Why not stick to those basic principles, when society uses very complicated process to establish, verifies them through voting, debates,
philosophical debates, revolutions, economy ups and downs over hundreds, sometimes thousands of years, comes
up through [multi-national consensus](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/UDHR/Documents/UDHR_Translations/eng.pdf)?

I realize that this in its own a special culture - having no special culture at all.

## What to do instead of corporate culture?

Instead of calling something a culture, inventing some core values and so on, I would suggest to simply 
tie the moral core values of the company to the ones of modern societies as in U.S. stick to basic common principles.

Companies also have their own specific goals and properties caused by the markets they operate in - e.g. Amazon being a retailer
has to be margin efficient, Google has to be smart when it comes to search and A.I. I think these goals are more ojbective
and easier to understand because they don't try to step into complex moral values territory, could be changed over time
as the company evolves without fear of sacrificing some "core values" that made sense before.

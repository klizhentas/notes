# Company culture

Corporate culture is usually declared as a set of "core values" - moral and business principles that are declared explicitly,
enforced implicitly via rewards and punishment systems or explicitly with some hiring or performance evaluation process.

There are many ideas about good and bad company culture, suggestions on how to build one and different 
experiments conducted by founders building ones.

For example, some folk consider "Customer first" to be a bad core value whle "No B.S." to be a good one.

In the spirit of questioning everything, I have some questions and concerns about the whole idea.

## Why have special corporate culture at all?

Why company needs somewhat special culture or core values different from the culture of the society it exists in? 

There is a perception that special culture somehow contributes to the company success or failure,
differentiates the company from the competition and makes it good or a bad place to work. 

However I have never read the actual study on positive effects of corporate culture on the company success. In the ones that I have read, folks came to realization that basic common sense principles [still work the best](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html)

The other argument is that culture could be used to attract like-minded individuals,
however in my opinion it is hard to quantify what "like mindedness" usually means and whether it 
leads to good results. 

Even at companies I worked at/created we were sometimes stating implicit culture principles, that were successfully challenged by new team members and were proven to be wrong. For example in some of our hiring ads we mentioned that we are "hackers using emacs or vim" because we thought that it would attract some special folks - hackers, who like sitting in their terminals, and digging kernel sources.

Poeple joining the team found this line in the ad ridiculous, as they were using Microsoft VS or Eclipse. Turned out they were great hackers after all, and just laughed at this part of the ad. Later I realized that this was pretty stupid idea that editor choice somehow reflects personality of an engineer, but this is a good example of our biases masquerading as "culture" statements.

The third argument is that company culture can be used as a safe guard - to signal that company is a safe 
work environment for people of all groups and minorities. This argument resonates with me, mostly because in current by-defaut-hostile tech environment any company has to declare conformance to basic common principles to signal that its a safe and reasonable place to work, however I would not state that this requires some special company culture, and simple basic society norms still apply - the point that I'm going to elaborate on later.

## Dangers of implementing corporate culture.

Implementing any corporate culture is very often doing a social experiment on the company, sometimes
under pressure and with limited time span and resources while trying to find product-market-fit.

Here are some dangers I see when implementing and enforcing company culture, especially in a startup:

Implementation is usually done and promoted by leadership, this means there is a strong i
  incentive to everyone to "play along" even if they disagree. Even when declared as collaborative process
  still usually enforced and implemented by leadership. Middle management can use this as an opportunity
  to get rid of folks who usually disagree.
  
Failure of the expermient can result in company failure or high churn - e.g. Zappos and Github with their 
flat hierarchies. Leaders often find that well-intentioned culture statements, can lead to processes that 
are very dangerous for the team, e.g [here](https://a16z.com/2014/07/22/how-to-ruin-your-company-with-one-bad-process/)

Methods of establishing such cultures are scientifically unproven, for example folks conduct special 
"culture panels" filtering out candidates, but how do they know they have succeeded? Do they have a control group for this experiment? How do they  measure any success or failure?  Do they conduct anonimous interviews and studies to check effects?

For a larger company implementing a corporate culture very often leads to attracting "business consultants" helping out with culture - six sigma style folks who distract and annoy employees. As in "Pacific Bell Story" from 1987 using some obscure half mystic techniques and [imposing them on the poor working folks](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/23/from-inboxing-to-thought-showers-how-business-bullshit-took-over)

## No special culture

The society we live in promotes some basic core values we all share, e.g. be kind and respectful to each other, be polite, 
celebrate diversity and so on. Those basic principles are the fabric of our society, often invisible, ever changing,
but we can feel their presence and common agreement on all of them already.

Living in U.S. also teaches us to respect freedom of speech, promotes spirit of enterpreneurship, accept failure and 
establishes the rule of the law - great values in my opinion that are keys to America success story.

Why not stick to those basic principles, when society uses very complicated process to establish, verifies them through voting, debates,
philosophical debates, revolutions, economy ups and downs over hundreds, sometimes thousands of years, comes
up through [multi-national consensus](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/UDHR/Documents/UDHR_Translations/eng.pdf)?

I realize that this in its own a special culture - having no special culture at all.

## What to do instead of corporate culture?

Instead of calling something a culture, inventing some core values and so on, I would suggest to simply 
tie the moral core values of the company to the ones of modern societies as in U.S. stick to basic common principles.

Companies also have their own specific goals and properties caused by the markets they operate in - e.g. Amazon being a retailer
has to be margin efficient, Google has to be smart when it comes to search and A.I. I think these goals are more ojbective
and easier to understand because they don't try to step into complex moral values territory, could be changed over time
as the company evolves without fear of sacrificing some "core values" that made sense before. For example every startup has to be "nimble and agile", "experiment and break things" but after the startup has evolved in multi-national corporation and started building rockets, "nimble" as a corporate culture item probably won't longer apply at all times.

# Company culture

Corporate culture is usually declared as a set of "core values" - moral and business principles that are declared explicitly,
enforced implicitly using rewards and punishment system or explicitly with some hiring or performance evaluation process.

There are many ideas about good and bad company culture, suggestions on how to build one and many stories about different 
experiments conducted by company leaderships.

I was always curious about the whole space, mostly because I encountered statements declared as truths, while being very subjective and questionable.

For example, some consider "Customer first" to be a bad core value whle "No Bullshit" to be a good one.

In the spirit of questioning everything I wrote down my main concerns about the general idea, some cautinary tales and personal experiences I had with implementations go wrong and propose an alternative approach.

## Why have special corporate culture at all?

Why company needs somewhat special culture or core values different from the culture of the society it exists in? 

There is a perception that special culture somehow contributes to the company success or failure,
differentiates the company from the competition and makes it good or a bad place to work. 

However I have never read the actual study on positive effects of corporate culture on the company success. In the ones that I have read, folks came to realization that basic common sense principles [still works the best](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html).

The other argument is that culture could be used to attract like-minded people,
however in my opinion it is hard to quantify what "like mindedness" usually means and whether it 
leads to good results. 

Even at companies I worked at/co-founded we were sometimes stating implicit culture principles, that were successfully challenged by new team members and were proven to be wrong. For example in some of our hiring ads we mentioned that we are "hackers using emacs or vim" because we thought that it would attract some special folks - hackers, who like sitting in their terminals, and digging kernel sources.

Poeple joining the team found this line in the ad ridiculous, as they were using Microsoft VS or Eclipse. Turned out they were great hackers after all, and just laughed at this part of the ad. Later I realized that this was pretty stupid idea that editor choice somehow reflects personality of an engineer, but this is a good example of our biases masquerading as "culture" statements.

The third argument is that company culture can be used as a safe guard - to signal that company is a safe 
work environment for people of all groups and minorities. 

This argument resonates with me, mostly because in current by-defaut-hostile tech environment any company has to declare conformance to basic common principles to signal that its a safe and reasonable place to work, however I would not state that this requires some special company culture, and simple basic society norms will work great.


## Dangers of implementing company culture

Implementing any corporate culture is a social experiment on the people working at the company, sometimes
conducted with a limited time span and resources while simultaneously trying to find product-market-fit or reach business goals.

Here are some dangers I see when implementing and enforcing company culture, especially in a startup:

Implementation is usually done and promoted by leadership, this means there is a strong incentive to everyone to "play along" even if they disagree. 

Even when declared as collaborative process it is usually enforced and implemented by the leadership or higher level management. Middle management can use this as an opportunity to get rid of folks who usually disagree.
  
The failure of such expermient can result in company failure or high churn - e.g. [Zappos](https://qz.com/849980/zappos-is-struggling-with-holacracy-because-humans-arent-designed-to-operate-like-software/) and [Github](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-06/why-github-finally-abandoned-its-bossless-workplace) with their 
flat hierarchies. Leaders often find that well-intentioned culture statements, can lead to processes that 
are very dangerous for the team, e.g [here](https://a16z.com/2014/07/22/how-to-ruin-your-company-with-one-bad-process/)

Methods of establishing such cultures are scientifically unproven, for example folks conduct special 
"culture panels" filtering out candidates, but how do they know they have succeeded? In the blog posts CEOs implementing such cultures, never mention if they have a control group for this experiment, or how do they measure any success or failure and whether they conduct anonimous interviews and studies to check effects?

When I read those articles without mentioning any research or any prior phisophical and sociological basis, I think that this is then aspirational set of random things founders consider to be important at this particular moment of their lives, set of biases or beliefs stated as core values. 

For a larger company implementing a corporate culture very often leads to attracting "business consultants" helping out with culture - six sigma-style folks who distract and annoy employees. As in "Pacific Bell Story" from 1987 using some obscure half mystic techniques and [imposing them as a cult](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/23/from-inboxing-to-thought-showers-how-business-bullshit-took-over).

## How it all can go wrong

Several times I have personally encountered the company culture go wrong and leading to strange and unintended consequences. 

One of the companies I worked at declared that it treated every employee as "Friends and family". This core value did not work at all when company had to set a round of layoffs. Who fires their friends and family when things go bad? This tells me that while being well intentioned this value did not work at all in a professional setting when company has sometimes to fire people who underperform and reward high performers - things not compatible with "family and friends" value at all.

Another company wanted to foster techical leadership and invited us on the training session, where coach asked us to write our own obituaries and read them out loud. May be it is a cultural thing, but it did not resonate well with me as I was not ready for this very-personal exposure in a setting with folks who I met a day ago.

I am sure that both coach and the company were well-meaning, but so often mixing moral,personal and human values, principles and events in a rushed training session format leads to very strange and even ridiculous outcomes.

The best corporate trainings [I had](https://www.helloinnerspace.org/) were all about basic, human interactions promoted and reinforced simple truths like being respectful, careful, providing feedback and listening to each other. Those ones had big impact on me both in and outside of the company setting.

## No special culture culture

The society we live in promotes some basic core values we share, for example, be kind and respectful to each other, be polite, 
celebrate diversity, respect basic human rights.

U.S. also promotes the freedom of speech, the spirit of enterpreneurship, acceptance of failure and 
establishes the rule of the law - great values that are keys to America success story.

Those basic principles are the fabric of our society, often invisible, ever changing,
but we can feel their presence and are in common agreement on all of them already.

Why not stick to those basic principles, when society uses very complicated process to establish, verifies them through voting,
philosophical debates, revolutions, economy ups and downs over hundreds, sometimes thousands of years, comes
up through [multi-national consensus](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/UDHR/Documents/UDHR_Translations/eng.pdf)?

I realize that this in its own a special culture - having no special culture at all.

## Company goals as alternatives to company culture

Instead of calling something a culture, inventing some core values and conducting social experiments using risky and unproven social experiments, I would suggest to simply 
tie the moral core values of the company to basic principles of the modern society.

To differentiate from the other companies, companies should set and focus on specific goals caused by the markets they operate in and the products they are building - e.g. Amazon being a retailer
has to be margin efficient, Google has to be smart when it comes to search and A.I. 

I think these goals are more ojbective and easier to understand because they don't try to step into complex world of moral values territory, and could be changed over time
as the company evolves without fear of sacrificing some "core values" that made sense before. 

For example every startup has to be "nimble and agile", "experiment and break things" but after it has evolved in multi-national corporation and started building rockets, "nimble" as a corporate culture will be a problem, but changing a company goal for a rocket-building division will be a reasonable thing to do.

## Stating basic moral principles

As I mentioned before, our current tech culture is very toxic by default, that's why explicitly stating and over communicating basic principles is a good thing and should not be just a part of some company moral culture, but a minimum qualifying checklist for any company. 

Here are some good examples:

Stating that company is diverse and inclusive, for example as in [Nylas](https://www.nylas.com/jobs/) case: 

> Diversity and inclusion are core to our culture, and we are actively committed to building a more inclusive work environment.

Nylas signals that they care about diversity, and are concisous of the problem in the tech space.

In case of our company, Gravitational we [state](https://github.com/gravitational/careers/blob/master/senior-backend-engineer.md)

> We are also dedicated to our friends, families, and hobbies outside of work. Our past experiences building companies taught us about the importance of life and work balance. It matters even more when you are building a huge and lasting company, like Gravitational.

This is to signal that we are family-friendly and won't exploit people's time working with us.

This is a good way to signal that company is concious about being a safe space for all kinds people to work on.

[Netflix] no [brilliat jerks](https://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664/36-Brilliant_Jerks_Some_companies_tolerate) described in [Brendan Gregg's blog](http://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2017-11-13/brilliant-jerks.html) states:

> Do not tolerate brilliant jerks. The cost of teamwork is too high.

This is a good way to signal that company cares about people being polite and professinal to each other.

I would argue again, that these should not be some differentiating company culture principles, but these are in fact basic society moral principles reinforced by companies that care and translated to work environment terms.

I think that many companies get away with their corporate cultures, because they simply pick (sometimes randomly) one of the basic society principles and apply it universally. People who work at those companies of course agree with not hiring jerks, avoiding bullshit or caring about customers and simply play along focusing on their daily jobs.

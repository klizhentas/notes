# Notes

I'm a Russian born software engineer currently living in U.S. and working on startups in the infrastructure space.

I was a founding engineer at [Mailgun](https://mailgun.com) and co-founded [Gravitational](https://gravitational.com) where I also work as a CTO.

Some of my past projects include OSS Load Balancer [Vulcand](https://github.com/vulcand) and [MIME parsing library](https://github.com/mailgun/flanker).

This is a collection of my notes on the technology and cultural aspects of the computer industry.
